I had used R a little previously, so getting started was easy.
I managed to install all required packages and knit [Exercise Set 1](./Exercise1.html).

Dealing with Github has been quite annoying because the website has been really slow to update after pushing.

**R for Health Data Science** is helpful for getting started, but on some topics I would prefer more information and examples. I found Exercise Set 1 a useful companion to the book.
